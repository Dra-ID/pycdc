# Decompyle++ 
***A Python Byte-code Disassembler/Decompiler***

Decompyle++ aims to translate compiled Python byte-code back into valid
and human-readable Python source code. While other projects have achieved
this with varied success, Decompyle++ is unique in that it seeks to
support byte-code from any version of Python.
